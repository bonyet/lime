# lime
A programming language

Very much WIP although kind of works a bit?

Currently, paths in the premake5.lua file are hard-coded to fit my directory structure, so you won't be able to build the project files (I know, I'm so kind).
There are also **lots** of issues I am aware of in the code. Many of them are marked with TODOs, but any more that you can find, tell me.
