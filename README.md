# lime
A programming language

This project is still very much a work in progress. There are many known bugs and TODOs scattered around the codebase. That being said, certain features are complete:

1. Variables (local and global)
2. Arithmetic
3. Functions

Not exactly the largest list, by any means, but it's a start.

This file will be changed to include documentation and examples once the language is in a usable state.

Currently, paths in the premake5.lua file are hard-coded, so you won't be able to build the project files (I know, I'm so kind).
